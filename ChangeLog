    *** Release 7.0.1 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 7.0.0:

    Bug fixes:
        - Fix ARM64/aarch64 spinup code to properly support Apple Silicon
          chips.
        - Prevent users from building Limine with a GNU Make version older than
          4.2, as that is not supported, by gracefully erroring out with a
          useful error message.
        - Avoid usage of reserved C identifiers in certain cases.

    Miscellaneous:
        - Drop usage of "libgcc-binaries" for "cc-runtime". This finally makes
          us able to ship Limine tarballs without included binary blobs, and
          should improve compatibility with more obscure toolchain set ups.

    *** Release 7.0.0 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 6.20240107.0:

    Bug fixes:
        - Minor fix of newline handling when reading user input lines.

    Miscellanous:
        - Bump major version to 7. Note: There is no breaking change in 7.x
          compared to 6.x; the major version bump is done due to a change in
          the versioning scheme used by Limine (move to proper Semantic
          Versioning).
        - Fix versions of external dependencies in "bootstrap" script.
