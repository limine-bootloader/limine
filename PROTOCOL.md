# The Limine Boot Protocol

The Limine boot protocol is a modern, portable, featureful, and extensible boot
protocol.

This file serves as the official centralised collection of features that
the Limine boot protocol is comprised of. Other bootloaders may support extra
unofficial features, but it is strongly recommended to avoid fragmentation
and submit new features by opening a pull request to the Limine repository.

The [limine.h](/limine.h) file provides an implementation of all the
structures and constants described in this document, for the C and C++
languages.

## General Notes

All pointers are 64-bit wide. All non-NULL pointers point to the object with the
higher half direct map offset already added to them, unless otherwise noted.

All responses and associated data structures are placed in bootloader-reclaimable
memory regions.

The calling convention matches the C ABI for the specific architecture
(SysV for x86, AAPCS LP64 for aarch64, LP64 for riscv64).

## Base protocol revisions

The Limine boot protocol comes in several base revisions; so far, 3
base revisions are specified: 0, 1, and 2.

Base protocol revisions change certain behaviours of the Limine boot protocol
outside any specific feature. The specifics are going to be described as
needed throughout this specification.

Base revision 0 and 1 are considered deprecated. Base revision 0 is the default base revision
a kernel is assumed to be requesting and complying to if no base revision tag
is provided by the kernel, for backwards compatibility.

A base revision tag is a set of 3 64-bit values placed somewhere in the loaded kernel
image on an 8-byte aligned boundary; the first 2 values are a magic number
for the bootloader to be able to identify the tag, and the last value is the
requested base revision number. Lack of base revision tag implies revision 0.

```c
#define LIMINE_BASE_REVISION(N) \
    uint64_t limine_base_revision[3] = { 0xf9562b2d5c95a6c8, 0x6a7b384944536bdc, (N) };
```

If a bootloader drops support for an older base revision, the bootloader must
fail to boot a kernel requesting such base revision. If a bootloader does not yet
support a requested base revision (i.e. if the requested base revision is higher
than the maximum base revision supported), it must boot the kernel using any
arbitrary revision it supports, and communicate failure to comply to the kernel by
*leaving the 3rd component of the base revision tag unchanged*.
On the other hand, if the kernel's requested base revision is supported,
*the 3rd component of the base revision tag must be set to 0 by the bootloader*.

Note: this means that unlike when the bootloader drops support for an older base
revision and *it* is responsible for failing to boot the kernel, in case the
bootloader does not yet support the kernel's requested base revision,
it is up to the kernel itself to fail (or handle the condition otherwise).

## Features

The protocol is centered around the concept of request/response - collectively
named "features" - where the kernel requests some action or information from
the bootloader, and the bootloader responds accordingly, if it is capable of
doing so.

In C terms, a feature is comprised of 2 structures: the request, and the response.

A request has 3 mandatory members at the beginning of the structure:
```c
struct limine_example_request {
    uint64_t id[4];
    uint64_t revision;
    struct limine_example_response *response;
    ... optional members follow ...
};
```
* `id` - The ID of the request. This is an 8-byte aligned magic number that the
bootloader will scan for inside the loaded executable image to find requests. Requests
may be located anywhere inside the loaded executable image as long as they are 8-byte
aligned. There may only be 1 of the same request. The bootloader will refuse
to boot an executable with multiple of the same request IDs. Alternatively,
it is possible to provide a list of requests explicitly via an executable file section.
See "Limine Requests Section". (Note: this is deprecated and removed in base revision 1)
* `revision` - The revision of the request that the kernel provides. This starts at 0 and is
bumped whenever new members or functionality are added to the request structure.
Bootloaders process requests in a backwards compatible manner, *always*. This
means that if the bootloader does not support the revision of the request,
it will process the request as if were the highest revision that the bootloader
supports.
* `response` - This field is filled in by the bootloader at load time, with a
pointer to the response structure, if the request was successfully processed.
If the request is unsupported or was not successfully processed, this field
is *left untouched*, meaning that if it was set to `NULL`, it will stay that
way.

A response has only 1 mandatory member at the beginning of the structure:
```c
struct limine_example_response {
    uint64_t revision;
    ... optional members follow ...
};
```
* `revision` - Like for requests, bootloaders will instead mark responses with a
revision number. This revision is not coupled between requests and responses,
as they are bumped individually when new members are added or functionality is
changed. Bootloaders will set the revision to the one they provide, and this is
*always backwards compatible*, meaning higher revisions support all that lower
revisions do.

This is all there is to features. For a list of official Limine features, read
the "Feature List" section below.

## Requests Delimiters

The bootloader can be told to start and/or stop searching for requests (including base
revision tags) in an executable's loaded image by placing start and/or end markers,
on an 8-byte aligned boundary.

The bootloader will only accept requests placed between the last start marker found (if
there happen to be more than 1, which there should not, ideally) and the first end
marker found.
```c
#define LIMINE_REQUESTS_START_MARKER \
    uint64_t limine_requests_start_marker[4] = { 0xf6b8f4b39de7d1ae, 0xfab91a6940fcb9cf, \
                                                 0x785c6ed015d3e316, 0x181e920a7852b9d9 };

#define LIMINE_REQUESTS_END_MARKER \
    uint64_t limine_requests_end_marker[2] = { 0xadc0e0531bb10d03, 0x9572709f31764c62 };
```

For base revisions 0 and 1, the requests delimiters are *hints*. The bootloader can still search for
requests and base revision tags outside the delimited area if it doesn't support the hints.

Base revision 2's sole difference compared to base revision 1 is that support for
request delimiters has to be provided and the delimiters must be honoured, if present,
rather than them just being a hint.

## Limine Requests Section

Note: *This behaviour is deprecated and removed as of base protocol revision 1*

For kernels requesting deprecated base revision 0,
if the executable kernel file contains a `.limine_reqs` section, the bootloader
will, instead of scanning the executable for requests, fetch the requests
from a NULL-terminated array of pointers to the provided requests, contained
inside said section.

## Entry memory layout

The protocol mandates kernels to load themselves at or above
`0xffffffff80000000`. Lower half kernels are *not supported*. For relocatable kernels
asking to be loaded at address 0, a minimum slide of `0xffffffff80000000` is applied.

At handoff, the kernel will be properly loaded and mapped with appropriate
MMU permissions, as supervisor, at the requested virtual memory address (provided it is at
or above `0xffffffff80000000`).

No specific physical memory placement is guaranteed, except that the loaded kernel image
is guaranteed to be physically contiguous. In order to determine
where the kernel is loaded in physical memory, see the Kernel Address feature
below.

Alongside the loaded kernel, the bootloader will set up memory mappings as such:

```
 Base Physical Address |                               | Base Virtual Address
 ----------------------+-------------------------------+-----------------------
                       |    (4 GiB - 0x1000) and any   |
  0x0000000000001000   |  additional memory map region |  0x0000000000001000
                       |    (Base revision 0 only)     |
 ----------------------+-------------------------------+-----------------------
                       |     4 GiB and additional      |
  0x0000000000000000   |  memory map regions depending |      HHDM start
                       |       on base revision        |
```
Where "HHDM start" is returned by the Higher Half Direct Map feature (see below).
These mappings are supervisor, read, write, execute (-rwx).

For base revision 0, the above-4GiB identity and HHDM mappings cover any memory
map region.

For base revisions 1 and 2, the above-4GiB HHDM mappings do not comprise memory map regions
of types:
 - Reserved
 - Bad memory

The bootloader page tables are in bootloader-reclaimable memory (see Memory Map
feature below), and their specific layout is undefined as long as they provide
the above memory mappings.

If the kernel is a position independent executable, the bootloader is free to
relocate it as it sees fit, potentially performing KASLR (as specified by the
config).

## Caching

### x86-64

The kernel executable, loaded at or above `0xffffffff80000000`, sees all of its
segments mapped using write-back (WB) caching at the page tables level.

All HHDM and identity map memory regions are mapped using write-back (WB) caching at the page
tables level, except framebuffer regions which are mapped using write-combining
(WC) caching at the page tables level.

The PAT's (Page Attribute Table) layout is specified to be as follows:
```
PAT0 -> WB
PAT1 -> WT
PAT2 -> UC-
PAT3 -> UC
PAT4 -> WP
PAT5 -> WC
PAT6 -> unspecified
PAT7 -> unspecified
```

The MTRRs are left as the firmware set them up.

### aarch64

The kernel executable, loaded at or above `0xffffffff80000000`, sees all of its
segments mapped using Normal Write-Back RW-Allocate non-transient caching mode.

All HHDM and identity map memory regions are mapped using the Normal Write-Back RW-Allocate
non-transient caching mode, except for the framebuffer regions, which are
mapped in using an unspecified caching mode, correct for use with the
framebuffer on the platform.

The `MAIR_EL1` register will at least contain entries for the above-mentioned
caching modes, in an unspecified order.

In order to access MMIO regions, the kernel must ensure the correct caching mode
is used on its own.

### riscv64

If the `Svpbmt` extension is available, all framebuffer memory regions are mapped
with `PBMT=NC` to enable write-combining optimizations. The kernel executable,
loaded at or above `0xffffffff80000000`, and all HHDM and identity map memory regions are mapped
with the default `PBMT=PMA`.

If the `Svpbmt` extension is not available, no PMAs can be overridden (effectively,
everything is mapped with `PBMT=PMA`).

### loongarch64

The kernel executable, loaded at or above `0xffffffff80000000`, sees all of its
segments mapped using the Coherent Cached (CC) memory access type (MAT).

All HHDM and identity map memory regions are mapped using the Coherent Cached (CC)
MAT, except for the framebuffer regions, which are mapped in using the
Weakly-ordered UnCached (WUC) MAT.

## Machine state at entry

### x86-64

`rip` will be the entry point as defined as part of the executable file format,
unless the Entry Point feature is requested (see below), in which case, the value
of `rip` is going to be taken from there.

At entry all segment registers are loaded as 64 bit code/data segments, limits
and bases are ignored since this is 64-bit mode.

The GDT register is loaded to point to a GDT, in bootloader-reclaimable memory,
with at least the following entries, starting at offset 0:

  - Null descriptor
  - 16-bit code descriptor. Base = `0`, limit = `0xffff`. Readable.
  - 16-bit data descriptor. Base = `0`, limit = `0xffff`. Writable.
  - 32-bit code descriptor. Base = `0`, limit = `0xffffffff`. Readable.
  - 32-bit data descriptor. Base = `0`, limit = `0xffffffff`. Writable.
  - 64-bit code descriptor. Base and limit irrelevant. Readable.
  - 64-bit data descriptor. Base and limit irrelevant. Writable.

The IDT is in an undefined state. Kernel must load its own.

IF flag, VM flag, and direction flag are cleared on entry. Other flags
undefined.

PG is enabled (`cr0`), PE is enabled (`cr0`), PAE is enabled (`cr4`),
WP is enabled (`cr0`), LME is enabled (`EFER`), NX is enabled (`EFER`) if available.
If 5-level paging is requested and available, then 5-level paging is enabled
(LA57 bit in `cr4`).

The A20 gate is opened.

Legacy PIC (if available) and IO APIC IRQs (only those with delivery mode fixed
(0b000) or lowest priority (0b001)) are all masked.

If booted by EFI/UEFI, boot services are exited.

`rsp` is set to point to a stack, in bootloader-reclaimable memory, which is
at least 64KiB (65536 bytes) in size, or the size specified in the Stack
Size Request (see below). An invalid return address of 0 is pushed
to the stack before jumping to the kernel.

All other general purpose registers are set to 0.

### aarch64

`PC` will be the entry point as defined as part of the executable file format,
unless the Entry Point feature is requested (see below), in which case,
the value of `PC` is going to be taken from there.

The contents of the `VBAR_EL1` register are undefined, and the kernel must load
its own.

The `MAIR_EL1` register contents are described above, in the caching section.

All interrupts are masked (`PSTATE.{D, A, I, F}` are set to 1).

The kernel is entered in little-endian AArch64 EL1t (EL1 with `PSTATE.SP` set to
0, `PSTATE.E` set to 0, and `PSTATE.nRW` set to 0).

Other fields of `PSTATE` are undefined.

At entry: the MMU (`SCTLR_EL1.M`) is enabled, the I-Cache and D-Cache
(`SCTLR_EL1.{I, C}`) are enabled, data alignment checking (`SCTLR_EL1.A`) is
disabled. SP alignment checking (`SCTLR_EL1.{SA, SA0}`) is enabled. Other fields
of `SCTLR_EL1` are reset to 0 or to their reserved value.

Higher ELs do not interfere with accesses to vector or floating point
instructions or registers.

Higher ELs do not interfere with accesses to the generic timer and counter.

The used translation granule size for both `TTBR0_EL1` and `TTBR1_EL1` is 4KiB.

`TCR_EL1.{T0SZ, T1SZ}` are set to 16 under 4-level paging, or 12 under 5-level
paging. Additionally, for 5-level paging, `TCR_EL1.DS` is set to 1.

`TTBR1_EL1` points to the bootloader-provided higher half page tables.
For base revision 0, `TTBR0_EL1` points to the bootloader-provided identity
mapping page tables, and is unspecified for all other base revisions and can
thus be freely used by the kernel.

If booted by EFI/UEFI, boot services are exited.

`SP` is set to point to a stack, in bootloader-reclaimable memory, which is
at least 64KiB (65536 bytes) in size, or the size specified in the Stack
Size Request (see below).

All other general purpose registers (including `X29` and `X30`) are set to 0.
Vector registers are in an undefined state.

### riscv64

At entry the machine is executing in Supervisor mode.

`pc` will be the entry point as defined as part of the executable file format,
unless the Entry Point feature is requested (see below), in which case, the
value of `pc` is going to be taken from there.

`x1`(`ra`) is set to 0, the kernel must not return from the entry point.

`x2`(`sp`) is set to point to a stack, in bootloader-reclaimable memory, which is
at least 64KiB (65536 bytes) in size, or the size specified in the Stack
Size Request (see below).

`x3`(`gp`) is set to 0, kernel must load its own global pointer if needed.

All other general purpose registers, with the exception of `x5`(`t0`), are set to 0.

If booted by EFI/UEFI, boot services are exited.

`stvec` is in an undefined state. `sstatus.SIE` and `sie` are set to 0.

`sstatus.FS` and `sstatus.XS` are both set to `Off`.

Paging is enabled with the paging mode specified by the Paging Mode feature (see below).

The (A)PLIC, if present, is in an undefined state.

### loongarch64

At entry the machine is executing in PLV0.

`$pc` will be the entry point as defined as part of the executable file format,
unless the Entry Point feature is requested (see below), in which case, the
value of `$pc` is going to be taken from there.

`$r1`(`$ra`) is set to 0, the kernel must not return from the entry point.

`$r3`(`$sp`) is set to point to a stack, in bootloader-reclaimable memory, which is
at least 64KiB (65536 bytes) in size, or the size specified in the Stack
Size Request (see below).

All other general purpose registers, with the exception of `$r12`(`$t0`), are set to 0.

If booted by EFI/UEFI, boot services are exited.

`CSR.EENTRY`, `CSR.MERRENTRY` and `CSR.DWM0-3` are in an undefined state.

`PG` in `CSR.CRMD` is 1, `DA` is 0, `IE` is 0 and `PLV` is 0 but is otherwise unspecified.

`CSR.TLBRENTRY` is filled with a provided TLB refill handler.

    void *address;
    uint64_t width;
    uint64_t height;
    uint64_t pitch;
    uint16_t bpp; // Bits per pixel
    uint8_t memory_model;
    uint8_t red_mask_size;
    uint8_t red_mask_shift;
    uint8_t green_mask_size;
    uint8_t green_mask_shift;
    uint8_t blue_mask_size;

```

`modes` is an array of `mode_count` pointers to `struct limine_video_mode` describing the
available video modes for the given framebuffer.

`edid` points to the screen's EDID blob, if available, else NULL.

    uint64_t width;
    uint64_t height;
    uint16_t bpp;
    uint8_t memory_model;
    uint8_t red_mask_size;
    uint8_t red_mask_shift;
    uint8_t green_mask_size;
    uint8_t green_mask_shift;
    uint8_t blue_mask_size;
    uint8_t blue_mask_shift;
};
```

### Paging Mode Feature

The Paging Mode feature allows the kernel to control which paging mode is enabled
before control is passed to it.

ID:
```c
#define LIMINE_PAGING_MODE_REQUEST { LIMINE_COMMON_MAGIC, 0x95c1a0edab0944cb, 0xa4e5cb3842f7488a }
```

Request:
```c
struct limine_paging_mode_request {
    uint64_t id[4];
    uint64_t revision;
    struct limine_paging_mode_response *response;
    uint64_t mode;
    /* Request revision 1 and above */
    uint64_t max_mode;
    uint64_t min_mode;
};
```

The `mode`, `max_mode`, and `min_mode` fields take architecture-specific values
as described below.

`mode` is the preferred paging mode by the OS; the bootloader should always aim
to pick this mode unless unavailable or overridden by the user in the bootloader's
configuration file.

`max_mode` is the highest paging mode in numerical order that the OS supports. The
bootloader will refuse to boot the OS if no paging modes of this type or lower
(but equal or greater than `min_mode`) are available.

`min_mode` is the lowest paging mode in numerical order that the OS supports. The
bootloader will refuse to boot the OS if no paging modes of this type or greater
(but equal or lower than `max_mode`) are available.

The `LIMINE_PAGING_MODE_DEFAULT`, `LIMINE_PAGING_MODE_MAX`, and `LIMINE_PAGING_MODE_MIN`
macros are provided by all architectures, where the latter 2 define the maximum and
minimum paging modes supported by the current Limine protocol specification.

If no Paging Mode Request is provided, the values of `mode`, `max_mode`, and `min_mode`
that the bootloader assumes are `LIMINE_PAGING_MODE_DEFAULT`, `LIMINE_PAGING_MODE_DEFAULT`,
and `LIMINE_PAGING_MODE_MIN`, respectively.

If request revision 0 is used, the values of `max_mode` and `min_mode` that the
bootloader assumes are the value of `mode` and `LIMINE_PAGING_MODE_MIN`,
respectively.

Response:
```c
struct limine_paging_mode_response {
    uint64_t revision;
    uint64_t mode;
};
```

The response indicates which paging mode was actually enabled by the bootloader.
Kernels must be prepared to handle cases where the provided paging mode is
not supported.

```

Request:
```c
struct limine_smp_request {
    uint64_t id[4];
    uint64_t revision;
    struct limine_smp_response *response;
    uint64_t flags;
};
```

* `flags` - Bit 0: Enable X2APIC, if possible. (x86-64 only)

#### x86-64:

Response:

```c
struct limine_smp_response {
    uint64_t revision;
    uint32_t flags;
    uint32_t bsp_lapic_id;
    uint64_t cpu_count;
    struct limine_smp_info **cpus;
};
```

* `flags` - Bit 0: X2APIC has been enabled.
* `bsp_lapic_id` - The Local APIC ID of the bootstrap processor.
* `cpu_count` - How many CPUs are present. It includes the bootstrap processor.
* `cpus` - Pointer to an array of `cpu_count` pointers to
`struct limine_smp_info` structures.

Note: The presence of this request will prompt the bootloader to bootstrap
the secondary processors. This will not be done if this request is not present.

Note: The MTRRs of APs will be synchronised by the bootloader to match
the BSP, as Intel SDM requires (Vol. 3A, 12.11.5).

```c
struct limine_smp_info;

typedef void (*limine_goto_address)(struct limine_smp_info *);

struct limine_smp_info {
    uint32_t processor_id;
    uint32_t lapic_id;
    uint64_t reserved;
    limine_goto_address goto_address;
    uint64_t extra_argument;
};
```

* `processor_id` - ACPI Processor UID as specified by the MADT
* `lapic_id` - Local APIC ID of the processor as specified by the MADT
* `goto_address` - An atomic write to this field causes the parked CPU to
jump to the written address, on a 64KiB (or Stack Size Request size) stack. A pointer to the
`struct limine_smp_info` structure of the CPU is passed in `RDI`. Other than
that, the CPU state will be the same as described for the bootstrap
processor. This field is unused for the structure describing the bootstrap
processor. For all CPUs, this field is guaranteed to be NULL when control is first passed
to the bootstrap processor.
* `extra_argument` - A free for use field.

    uint64_t base;
    uint64_t length;
    uint64_t type;
};
```

Note: Memory between 0 and 0x1000 is never marked as usable memory.
The kernel and modules loaded are not marked as usable memory.
They are marked as Kernel/Modules. The entries are guaranteed to be sorted by
base address, lowest to highest. Usable and bootloader reclaimable entries
are guaranteed to be 4096 byte aligned for both base and length. Usable and
bootloader reclaimable entries are guaranteed not to overlap with any other
entry. To the contrary, all non-usable entries (including kernel/modules) are
not guaranteed any alignment, nor is it guaranteed that they do not overlap
other entries.

### Entry Point Feature

};
```

* `internal_module_count` - How many internal modules are passed by the kernel.
* `internal_modules` - Pointer to an array of `internal_module_count` pointers to
`struct limine_internal_module` structures.

Note: Internal modules are honoured if the module response has revision >= 1.

As part of `struct limine_internal_module`:

* `path` - Path to the module to load. This path is *relative* to the location of
the kernel.
* `cmdline` - Command line for the given module.
* `flags` - Flags changing module loading behaviour:
  - `LIMINE_INTERNAL_MODULE_REQUIRED`: Fail if the requested module is not found.
  - `LIMINE_INTERNAL_MODULE_COMPRESSED`: Deprecated. Bootloader may not support it and panic instead (from Limine 8.x onwards). Alternatively: the module is GZ-compressed and should be decompressed by the bootloader. This is honoured if the response is revision 2 or greater.

Internal Limine modules are guaranteed to be loaded *before* user-specified
(configuration) modules, and thus they are guaranteed to appear before user-specified
modules in the `modules` array in the response.

Response:
```c
struct limine_module_response {
    uint64_t revision;
    uint64_t module_count;
